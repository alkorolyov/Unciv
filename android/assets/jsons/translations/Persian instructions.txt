Notes for Pinglish DIN:

# If you want to add new translations, please follow these guidelines (for unification purposes):
# In order to make the words short and clean, please use these special characters instead: (if you don’t want to copy paste these letters every time, you can simply use Microsoft Word and make a shortcut for each one of them in “Insert >> Symbol”)
# aa = ā (as in “āb” = water) (Ā, ā)
# ch = č (as in “čera” = why) (Č, č)
# kh = ḵ (as in “ḵām” = raw) (Ḵ, ḵ)
# zh = ž (as in “pižāme” = pajamas) (Ž, ž)
# sh = š (as in “šab” = night) (Š, š)
# gh = ğ (as in “ğāšoğ” = spoon) (Ğ, ğ)
# Please note that the letter ع(ein) does not have a direct translation, Simply because there is no need to, like in “edālat”(=justice) or “abas”(=vain) however, In words like “Sa’adi”(a famous poet) where the /∅/ is tangible, I opted to use apostrophe (‘) and put the two vowels that are heard before and after ‘ein’ around it, Like in Sa’adi (sa + a + di) you hear ‘a’ before and after ‘ein’, In a word like “sa’ādat” (=happiness, felicity, well-being) since its pronounced as (sa + ā + dat), I put “a’ā” instead of ‘ein’.
# If you encountered a word which had ‘tashdid’ (it was intensified in pronunciation), Like “Mohabbat” (=kindness) just write the vowel that was intensified twice.
# Don’t use ‘u’ instead of ‘oo’ (like “rood” (= river) instead of “rud”).
# Avoid using ‘ee’ as much as possible, use ‘i’instead (like “ḵātere i ḵoob” (= a good memory), instead of “ḵātere ee ḵoob”)
# And also just like English, use capital letters for special names and at the beginning of sentences.
# To make the translations more in line with the contemporaneous Persian language I have changed some nouns to a more common one, or something that makes sense, like there is no direct translation for ‘warpath’ so considering the phrase (The Great Warpath) I opted to translate it as ‘warrior’ instead.

# PLEASE NOTE! This alphabet was derivated from “DIN 31635” standard however, IT’S NOT COMMON AMONG IRANIANS TO WRITE PINGLISH LIKE THIS. They usually use “ch”, “kh”, “zh”, etc. instead of these letters, So if you decided to make this translation obey those rules, please add it as a new language called “Persian (Pinglish UN)” since that is the alphabet which is approved by the United Nations as a substitute for the official Persian alphabet.

# PLEASE NOTE! This alphabet was derivated from “ALA_LC” standard. It is also similar to the standard approved by the United Nations before their 2012 review
